# meteogrammer
Gets meteogram from yr, and stylizes it with imagemagick. End goal is to hang the picture like a live updated painting.

Hopefully with some form of e-ink display.
probably with a piZero

The command:

<pre><code>feh --reload 0.1 --fullscreen meteogram.png
</code></pre>

Will auto reload the image every 0.1 seconds.. which is probably totally overkill..
